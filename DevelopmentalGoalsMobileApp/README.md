# Overview - Android App (Expandable List App)
My primary job responsibility involves working within groups of 8-12 individuals, each of whom has an extensive binder containing their developmental goal documentation. Managing this documentation often necessitates multiple trips to storage cabinets, diverting my attention away from the group. This application addresses this challenge by providing me with convenient access to their documentation on a tablet. The information is organized in a list format, with each person's documentation stored under their name in a collapsible list item.

While the application is still in its early stages and requires further development, it serves as a starting point for a larger project. This undertaking will not only enable me to contribute to a more substantial and useful project in the future but also serve as a valuable opportunity for learning mobile application development.

# Development Environment Notes

Sprint01 - The initial stage of this project was developed entirely using Android Studio. While initially considering React Native, further research led me to pivot towards Java with a brief consideration for Native C++. The ultimate decision to go with Java/Android SDK was influenced by the project's time constraints.
