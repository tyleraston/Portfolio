# Overview

This project aims to enhance my skills in data analysis and visualization by examining autism prevalence studies. The dataset provides information from peer-reviewed autism prevalence studies, including prevalence estimates and study characteristics such as case ascertainment and criteria. The data was compiled from studies published up to September 2020, and it was obtained from [Data Source Link](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/autism-prevalence-studies).

The purpose of this software is to analyze trends and variations in autism prevalence, helping to inform public health strategies and improve support for individuals with autism.
